## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r SW_Load_p}
#Load Common R Libraries to examine the data set.

library("car")
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("ggpubr")
library("tidyverse")
library("broom")
library("gplots")
library("coin")
library("multcompView")
library("BSDA")
library("DescTools")
library("effsize")
library("AICcmodavg")
library("rcompanion")
```


```{r SW_Load_Data}
#Load Data File and Filter to Pull Required Data for the data test.

SolarWind_PRE = read.csv("WindSolar_State9.csv",header = TRUE)
```


```{r SW_Filter_Data}

# Filter ony required data to standardize the comparisons.

SolarWind <- filter(SolarWind_PRE,  #SolarWind_PRE$State == c('California','Arizona'),
                                  SolarWind_PRE$Type %in% c('Wind','Photo'),
                                  SolarWind_PRE$Com_Type %in%  
                                   c('Commercial','Residential','Industrial'),
                                  SolarWind_PRE$Total > 0)
```


```{r SW_Display_Data}
# Load data set to see that the data displays properly and filters correctly.
head(SolarWind)

```


```{r SW_Str}
#Display Data in Dataframe again showing more values.

str(SolarWind)
```


```{r SW_Sum_Total}
#Sum Total Data field

sum(SolarWind$Total)

```


```{r SW_SummaryData1}
#Summary of Data Frame

summary(SolarWind)
```


```{r SW_name}
#Fields in Data Frame summary data.

names(SolarWind)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r SW_Factor}

# Data Discovery
# Change Data Types to Factors

SolarWind$Type <- as.factor(SolarWind$Type)
SolarWind$Com_Type <- as.factor(SolarWind$Com_Type)
SolarWind$Total <- as.numeric(SolarWind$Total)

is.factor(SolarWind$State)
is.factor(SolarWind$Type)
is.factor(SolarWind$Com_Type)
is.numeric(SolarWind$Total)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r SW_FactorState}
# Table Data Types to Show Values by Type

table(SolarWind$Type)
table(SolarWind$Com_Type)

```
